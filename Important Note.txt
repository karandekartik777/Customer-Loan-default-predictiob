Hi.
kartik karande Here,
The data which you provided was so Huge for my laptop it was taking lots of time to load.
To overcome that problem, Devided whole model in 3 part  

1> Baseline model (in which we are calculating the baseling accuracy 
   without any EDA or Feature engineering)
2> Exploratory Data analysis and Visualizations
3> Feature Engineering and model building


Thank you
