I'm new to lending club, and given it's attractive interest rates I've decided to fund much of my medical expenses by borrowing through this program. My borrowing history is relatively light, and my credit is excellent at 760. Essentially, this financing will enable me to restructure my personal balance sheet, as most of my personal financing has historically been generated via cash assets. I have a very stable job situation, employed the past 4 years with Citigroup in its capital markets department. I graduated from Georgetown University in '06, and have recently been promoted to an Associate role with the firm in a rotationial program that will guarantee my job security for at least the next two years. My gross monthly salary totals close to 10k, my monthly expenses total close to 3k (rent: 1200, misc: 2k-mostly medical bills).<br/>",medical,Medical Loan,073xx,NJ,0.5,0.0,4.0,,,4.0,0.0,425.0,14.7,9.0,f,2539.21,29.8686786077,0.0,0.0,0.0,,INDIVIDUAL,,265th week,0.0,,,,1

The interest on each card is at 10% each. So if I consolidate all three into one and get a loan with just one interest rate, it would be great to just have 1 bill with a 10% interest rate instead of 3 cards that total 30%..<br/>  > Let me make a correction...I put 10% for the credit cards. What I meant to say was I would rather pay a fixed interest rate of 10% on just one loan rather than pay a variable interest on 3 credit cards. Which each credit card is at least 18% interest.  And what makes me a good candidate for repaying this loan off is that I am in the medical field which is in high demand so I do not see myself losing my job, I am in a very well stable field. As we all know there is a high demand in the medical field right, which is where I am right now. I pay my credit cards on time. I would just like to have the one monthly payment, instead of spreading them into 3 payments. Hoping to get the help that I need, as I will not disappoint anyone who is willing to help.<br/>  > I would also like to add that I had the option of doing a traditional bank loan, but when I found out about this peer to peer lending, I thought it was great that there are other individuals who are willing to invest their hard earned money to help others.

This can be found at TCABC.com under the teachings page if interested. The teaching on money margin really hit home, as my wife and I have made more money we have spent more money, like most Americans. We have gotten involved with Financial Peace University and started using Mint.com to help us achieve our goal of getting out of debt in 3 to 4 years. We have both been blessed to work for almost 10 years with companies that have shown steady growth even over the last 2 years instead of suffering from the economic downturn. I manage the recruiting for a division of one of the premier convenience store chains that has more new stores in development than it has in 20 years. We are doing very well. My wife is one the most popular pet groomers in the city, she has steady appointments booked for 2 to 3 months and has only seen growth each year despite the economy.

Current interest rates range for 12.90% to 26.99%. I will also be paying off the balance of my car of $14,900.00 with a payment of $683.00. Total of all debt to be paid off is $33,900.00 at payments at $1,188.00.<br/>Payment on the new loan should be $880.00 which shows a monthly debt savings of $308.00 per month, I should be able to apply this savings towards the new loan to shorten the term from 5 years to somewhere around 3.5 to 4 years.<br/>  <br/>What makes me a good borrower? I make a decent income of about $115,000.00 per year selling new homes for a large builder in a market that&rsquo;s been down but is now on its way back. While the housing market has been soft I have not had a decree in my income and my credit has not suffered. The large part of the debt is from my ex-wife which I took to help her knowing that she would not be able to pay which could affect my credit. I have never been late making payments on any of my debts and intend to keep it that way.<br/><br/>With this new loan my budget is simple, my mortgage payment is $1,780.00 and the new loan of $880.00 totals $2,660.00. My monthly income before taxes is around $9,400.00 per month so after my monthly obligations of $2,660.00 leaves me over $6,700 for living expenses, savings and investments. The main goal for this loan is to get out from under the credit card lenders and their high rates as well as getting the debts from my ex wife paid off.<br/>  <br/>Regarding my job stability, last year was one of my highest income years since I have been in the new home building market, 9 years total and each year is better for me. I just had my yearly review from corporate and I have been asked to open a new subdivision in one of the area&rsquo;s best markets so my income is projected to rise again.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>  > The following is the break down of my current debt;<br/>Chase, $1,664 - 26.99% - $56 min<br/>Chase, $5,798 - 25.24% - $180 min<br/>Sears, $720 - 25.24% - $15 min<br/>USAA AMEX, $4,955 - 15.9% - $117 min<br/>Capital One, $1,520 - 14.66% - $35 min<br/>Capital One, $80 - 13.40% - $15 min<br/>Household Bank, $4,300 - 12.9% - $90 min<br/>Addison FCU (car), $14,900 - 6.9% - $682.97 monthly<br/><br/>My current mortgage balance is $315,000 and valued about $345,000.<br/><br/>I hope that this additional information is helpful in reaching your decision.<br/><br/>Thank you again.<br/>  > Some additional information for investors;<br/>After using an online debt reduction calculator and inputting the details of the proposed loan I have calculated that I should be able to repay this note as early as 39 months keeping my current payment structure at $1,200.

My plan is to take my Lending Club loan and pay off the vehicle and replace that monthly payment (which I'm used to and have been paying without incident for 49 months already) with the Lending Club monthly payment of $488. That will save me $25 a month on my regular budget. Then I plan to take the remaining $13,000 and pay down my large Visa balance which is currently at 19.99%. The Lending Club loan repayment will not be difficult to work into my budget because I will be replacing my auto loan with it.<br/>null  > I'm disappointed that my loan has not been fully funded yet. I feel like I have proven with my excellent credit score that I don't mess around with things like money. I don't feel it is acceptable to miss a payment on an obligation; I don't feel it is acceptable to not take care of my finances. Having said that, things happen, and over the past few years, I was not able to meet some unexpected personal needs with cash. These needs are resolved and I would like some money to get my use of credit back on track. For starters, I would prefer to pay personal investors 15% interest than a credit card company 20% interest! Out of college, I worked for a fortune 500 company for 8 years and then relocated and have been working for a different fortune 500 company since the spring of 2005. I have been promoted twice since working for my current company; once in 2006 and again just a few months ago. The industry I'm working in and the job I have is not going anywhere in the foreseeable future. I feel very secure in my profession and my current role.

I have already done all the research on the franchise and it offers an excellent product and terrific franchisee support.  Their growth has been exponential over the last four (4) years.  To date, none of the franchises have ceased operations.  Edible Arrangements has availability to develop a store in Washington, DC or McLean, VA.  I am in line for either of the stores, if I can provide proof of $50,000 capital.  I have $30,000 of my own funds and need another $20,000 so I can move forward.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I am committed to (paying) my obligations.  I have always held steady employment.     I do not have experience in this particular industry, which is why I chose to move forward with a franchise for that added expertise and support.  I have eight years of HR experience, and my daughter, which will manage the day-to-day operations of the Edible Arrangements store, has HR experience and a degree in Business Administration. I will keep my full-time day job. That way I can keep a steady flow of income coming in.

Seems this has recently been my line.  Bought a home last year about this time and sunk all my savings into it to assure a very reasonable note.  Great idea, but unfortunately just a couple of days after moving in, things began to break!  Having had no time to accumulate any more savings, I was stuck utilizing a VERY high interest credit card, on which there was previously a balance of 0, to do things like replace a leaky roof, a faulty, exploding water heater, freshly soaked walls and carpet, etc....  Seems my home inspector might have caught those things but not so.  I do not hasten to appear as a damsel in distress; however, with an APR of 28%, I will be forever getting this card paid down!  <br/><br/>I would make an excellent candidate for this loan as my credit history is good, but in addition, the note on this loan is less than I am paying each month on this card with no end in sight.  In addition, my car will be paid off in 12 months so I plan to double up on loan installments after that and pay this loan off early.  It seems the only way I can get back ahead. Though I am having no problem making  my payments, right now I feel much like a hamster on a wheel.

None of the companies are willing to negotiate a better rate so I am wanting to pay them all off and not do business with those companies any longer. I don't mind paying interest that is agreed upon but when they just raise rates from one month to the next, after being an on time paying customer for years, I don't feel that is a good business practice. A small portion of the funds will also be used to replace the stairs leading from the back of my home down to the back yard which is about an 8 foot drop. The home is 9 years old and the stairs must be replaced.   The estimated payment for this loan is actually slightly less than what I pay for all my credit cards combined on a monthly basis so it will not impact my monthly budget at all. It will actually free up about $50.00 a month.  As far as employment, I have been with one company for almost 8 years now as an audio engineer and computer systems tech. It's a small company and very stable since we are diverse in the type of work we do. When the market drops in one area, our work load increases in other. My second job as an audio engineer/lighting director for a Production company is also very stable. We provide concert gear for several national acts as well as a local group that has had steady work for the passed 5 years now and are booked a minimum of 6 nights a week 12 months in advance. I was contract until the beginning of this year when I was made an employee. That company is only getting busier by the day.  As my credit shows. I have not had any negative marks for at least 5 years now. I have made a huge effort to organize myself financially and have achieved it. The credit cards I have were all opened to help raise my credit score and everything was going fine until the market freaked out as we all know and the banks started raising everyone's rates.",credit_card,Credit Card payoff and deck addition.,782xx,TX,23.48,0.0,1.0,,,12.0,0.0,11369.0,91.7,16.0,f,5858.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,INDIVIDUAL,,161th week,0.0,,,,1

Using the money to repair house so I can get a higher rental income/tennant. Remaining money going to conslidate outstanding debt (make it easier to pay 1 payment). 564203 added on 10/29/09 > Bit more information incase people are wondering: 1. Haven't missed a payment ever on anything 2. Revoling credit card is actually what I used to purchase house. Loan breakdown is as followed... 2,000 going toward repair remaining 10,000 used to pay down cash advance I took on credit card at 22% (other 10,000 was done at 8%) to buy house (Yes that is right for some it is a 20,000 home and yes it is rentable/livable the repairs are becuase I had a tennant in there and didn't pay rent and left the place dirty with problems and security deposit didn't cover it all). The rest of reovling creidt I pay every month (and hence no missed payments). House plan to rent for 500-600/mo range when completed repairs (repairs take 2-3 weeks max before back on market) and plan on using rent check to pay for loan. (Of course it is not needed as I make enough income without it). 3. 135/mo car payment 4. 500-600/mo rent target when repairs complete 5. 132/mo studnet loan 6. 275/mo credit card balance (the 8% one)  7. Income stated is all me, I have other rental properties but no way to verify this (and the income) it brings (is there?).  Why I haven't taken a HELCO on the houses I own for repairs? I have the houses in controllership of an LLC (that my wife and I own). For tax stargety I purposely want the LLC to have an external source (ME) providing capital for repairs rather than the LLC tapping into its own equity. It fits my long term goals of minimzing my tax payments. 564203 added on 10/30/09 > Update: I came into some money and don't need as high of a loan. I asked lending club to reduce from 12,000 to 3,500. I got fudning at a lower rate except for 3,500.

I had two credit cards with high credit line amounts cut down to just above the current amount owed (such as $21,000 to 10,900 and it drops every time I pay another 500 off). This ratio of total credit line to amount owed was always an emergency buffer in case of unforeseen expenses. This also affected my credit rating (was 730 a year ago) by lowering the owed to available ratio). I have a few expenses such as car repairs and a small garage roof leak which I'm putting off due to not enough credit card balance. I also have a few doctor bills (after the insurance paid their portion) for when my wife had a hospital visit due to a heart issue. I would use the money to pay these several small amounts and also pay off a few small amounts on store/gas/Dell credit accounts. The remainder would be kept in the bank as reserve so I wouldn't need to use a credit card and I can concentrate on paying them down to improve my credit rating.

I am a recent college graduate (class of '08) in Massachusetts who is employed by a private school's technology department.  My current gross annual income is 35,000 and I am receiving a promotion which will come into effect in early July.  While the new salary has not yet been negotiated, it will be a substantial increase (in excess of 10%).  I own a fully paid off car and rent a very inexpensive apartment (I have roommates, and pay a total of $400 a month after all utilities).    If you have already looked at my credit report, you will see that there are some small revolving balances as well as large installment ones.  The large installment balances are loans related to my education.  They are co-signed by my father, and he is the one who has been making the scheduled payments to them.  His financial situation is very secure and I see no reason he will not repay those ahead of schedule.    My request today, however, involves the revolving debt.  You will notice three accounts of interest, a Citi card account, a Capital One card account, and a Dell Financial Services account.  The three accounts charge 19%, 0%, and 0% respectively.  The Capital one account, while charging 0% currently, will soon increase its rate.  I expect to have the Dell account paid off well before the scheduled rate increase (in January).    As such, I've come to Lending Club seeking $6,000 to fully pay off my Citi and Capital one accounts.  Both credit cards were opened in my time between graduation and employment, an unfortunate but necessary way to raise funds.  My plan is to (pending loan approval) pay off the cards and then cease using them except for emergencies. My new income should be quite sufficient to live on and pay the Lending Club loan well before three years.    When selecting Lending Club two things attracted me.  One, of course, is the fantastic rates.  The other, however, is that I find the idea of small scale lenders (such as yourselves) making interest on my loans much preferable to the big banks to whom I am currently indebted.    Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to providing any additional information or clarification.

These windows meet the government's new requirements for the energy efficiency tax credit announced in June 2009.  Total project cost is $10, 821.00, a 10% deposit of $1082.00 has been provided to Paramount as earnest money.  I've never missed a mortgage payment on my home in over 17 years.  Current mortage loan to value on the home is 75%.  Property values have actually increased in this area despite national market trends over the last two years, due to the doubling in size of Fort Lee, VA as a result of the government's Base Realignment And Closure program.
